**Thinking in React - Summarized Steps:**

1. **Break Down the UI Into a Component Hierarchy:** Divide the user interface (UI) into smaller, reusable components that represent distinct parts of the UI. This helps in organizing the application's structure.

2. **Build a Static Version:** Create a static version of the UI using these components, without worrying about interactivity or state. This step helps in laying out the foundation of the visual design.

3. **Identify the Minimal (but complete) Representation of UI State:** Determine which components should have state and define the minimal set of mutable state needed to render the UI. Avoid duplicating state across components.

4. **Design the Component Tree:** Define where each piece of state should live. Identify the single source of truth for the state and pass it down as props to the components that need it. Components that don't need state can still receive data via props.

5. **Add Inverse Data Flow:** Establish the flow of data from child to parent components by passing callback functions as props. This enables child components to update the state of their parent components.

**State: A Componentâ€™s Memory:**

1. **Reason for Not Using Local Variables:** Local variables are not sufficient for managing a React component because they don't provide a way to retain and manage state across re-renders. They would get reinitialized every time the component re-renders, which is not suitable for maintaining dynamic and interactive UIs.

2. **Argument to the useState Hook and Return Array Parts:** The `useState` hook takes an initial value as its argument. It returns an array with two elements:
   - The current state value.
   - A function to update the state.

3. **Accessing State from Component A to Component B:** To allow Component A to access state from Component B, you need to lift the state up to a common ancestor of both components. This means moving the state to a shared parent component that can pass the state down to both Component A and Component B as props. This way, both components can access and manipulate the same state.
