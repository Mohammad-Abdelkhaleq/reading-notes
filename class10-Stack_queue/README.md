Introduction:
Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used in computer science to organize and manipulate data efficiently. Let's explore their key features and implementations.

1. Stacks:
- Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
- Analogy: Think of a stack of plates where you can only access the topmost plate.
- Operations: Push (add to the top), Pop (remove the top), Peek (view the top).
- Implementation: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

2. Queues:
- First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
- Analogy: Imagine a line of people where the first person who joins is the first one to leave.
- Operations: Enqueue (add to the rear), Dequeue (remove from the front).
- Implementation: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

3. Differences:
- Principle: Stacks follow LIFO, queues follow FIFO.
- Access: Stacks access only the top element, queues access both front and rear.
- Insertion and Deletion: Stacks insert and delete at the top, queues at the front and rear.

Conclusion:
Stacks and queues are essential data structures with distinct behaviors. Understanding their principles and implementations empowers efficient problem-solving in computer science.
