**Building Blocks of a React App:**
The building blocks of a React app are components. Components are the modular and reusable units that make up the user interface. They can be thought of as JavaScript functions that return JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript. Components can be divided into two types: functional components and class components.

**Difference Between HTML Element and React Component:**
While both HTML elements and React components represent parts of a user interface, React components offer more functionality and interactivity. React components can have their own state, manage their own lifecycle, and can be reused and composed more easily than plain HTML elements.

**JSX and Why It's Used:**
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to visualize and define the structure of the user interface. It gets transformed into regular JavaScript by tools like Babel before being interpreted by browsers.

**Embedding JavaScript Expressions in JSX:**
JavaScript expressions can be embedded in JSX using curly braces `{}`. For example: `<p>Hello, {name}!</p>`. This allows you to dynamically insert values into your JSX based on the current state or props of the component.

**Iteration and Conditional Logic in React/JSX:**
React provides map functions for iterating over arrays to render components dynamically, and conditional rendering can be achieved using ternary operators or if statements within JSX. This makes it possible to render components based on certain conditions or loops.

**Responding to User Inputs:**
React responds to user inputs through event handling. You can attach event handlers to React elements, such as `onClick` for handling click events. When the event occurs, React updates the component's state, triggering a re-render and reflecting the updated user interface.

**React Component Managing Data with a Hook:**
The term that indicates a React component is managing data with a Hook is "useState". Hooks are functions that allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components.

**Sharing Data Between React Components:**
Data sharing between components can be achieved using props for parent-to-child communication and through various state management libraries like Redux or the Context API for more complex cases.

**Three Steps of Refreshing a React UI:**
The three steps of refreshing a React UI are:
1. **Rendering:** The component renders JSX, creating a virtual representation of the user interface.
2. **Diffing:** React compares the previous virtual DOM with the new one to identify changes.
3. **Committing:** React applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM to reflect the updated UI.

**Triggering Component Updates:**
Component updates can be triggered by changing the component's state using the `setState` function or by receiving new props. React will automatically compare the previous and new states/props and update the component as needed.

**Recreating DOM Nodes on Rerender:**
No, React doesn't recreate all the DOM nodes on every re-render. It creates a virtual representation of the UI, compares it with the previous one, and then calculates the minimal changes required to update the real DOM efficiently.

**Finalizing DOM Changes:**
After React has updated the DOM, the browser still needs to perform the layout and painting steps before the user sees the change. These steps involve calculating the position of elements, rendering styles, and displaying the updated content on the screen.
