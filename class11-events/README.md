### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The "events" module in Node.js provides the EventEmitter class. You can use it to create custom events, register listeners with the  method, emit events with the  method, and remove listeners with the  method. This allows you to build event-driven applications in Node.js.

### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

OOP enhances Event-Driven Programming by promoting code encapsulation, reusability, modularity, and abstraction. It helps organize event handlers into objects, facilitates code reuse, modular design, and provides abstractions for handling different types of events. Together, OOP and EDP enable flexible and maintainable systems.

### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.


Event Driven Programming in Node.js on the backend allows you to handle multiple events simultaneously without blocking the entire application. It makes your backend more responsive and efficient, enabling you to handle user interactions and perform various tasks concurrently. This helps build scalable applications that can handle a large number of users and perform background tasks without slowing down the system.
