**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

*Node.js is like a powerful engine that allows developers to run JavaScript outside of web browsers. Just like how you can use JavaScript to make things happen on a website, Node.js lets you use JavaScript to build all sorts of things on a computer, It's a popular tool because it's fast, efficient, and can handle many things happening at the same time without slowing down. So, think of Node.js as a way for developers to use JavaScript to build cool stuff that runs on computers and servers, not just in web browsers* 

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**

*it means that Node.js provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, rather than just in the browser*

**What is Node used for?**

*Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration*
