**1. Difference between AWS SQS and SNS:**
SQS is a message queuing service for decoupling components, while SNS is for distributing messages to multiple subscribers.

**2. Use Cases for SQS and SNS:**
SQS for decoupling, load leveling, and asynchronous processing. SNS for push notifications, event broadcasting, and fanout pattern.

**3. Using SQS and SNS in a "Fanout" Pattern:**
Create an SNS topic as the message bus, subscribe SQS queues to it, and publish messages to the topic to deliver to all queues.

**4. How Push Notifications Work Using SNS:**
Mobile devices register with SNS, and backend subscribes devices to SNS topics. When a push notification is published, SNS delivers it to subscribed devices.

**5. SQS and SNS Basics:**
SQS - message queuing for communication. SNS - message distribution to subscribers.

**6. Large Scale Distributed Application and SQS Usage:**
SQS scales, ensures resilience, enables asynchronous processing, and decouples components for efficient load balancing in distributed applications.
