**Choosing the State Structure:**

The five principles for structuring state in a React application are:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain a single source of truth for your application's state. This helps in preventing data inconsistencies and making it easier to manage and update the state.

2. **State is Read-Only**: State should not be directly modified. Instead, changes should be made through controlled actions and updates. This ensures predictability and helps in tracking state changes.

3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: State changes are carried out using pure functions called reducers. These functions take the current state and an action as input and return a new state as output, without modifying the original state.

4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State changes follow a unidirectional flow. Actions trigger changes in the state, which in turn updates the user interface. This clarity simplifies debugging and understanding the application's behavior.

5. **Changes are Batched**: Multiple state updates are batched together for efficiency. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and optimizes the rendering process.

**Passing State Deeply with Context:**

**Contexts** in React aim to solve the problem of prop drilling, where you have to pass props through multiple levels of components just to reach a distant child component that needs the data. Contexts provide a way to share data without explicitly passing it through each component in the hierarchy.

**One technique to try before useContext:**

Before using the `useContext` hook, you can use the **prop drilling** technique. In this approach, you pass the required data as props from a higher-level component down to the component that needs the data. However, this can become cumbersome and less maintainable as the application grows and the component hierarchy becomes deeper.

**Hook that complements useContext for complex applications:**

For complex applications, the **useReducer** hook complements `useContext`. While `useContext` provides a way to access shared data, `useReducer` is a hook that can handle more complex state logic, especially when the state transitions involve multiple sub-states or require complex calculations before updating the state. It works well in conjunction with `useContext` to manage state and actions in a more organized manner.
