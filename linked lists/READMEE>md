# linked list 

In a linked list, the elements or nodes are connected together through pointers. Each node contains two parts: the data and the pointer to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements compared to other data structures like arrays.

To explain the concept further, let's use an analogy of a train. Imagine a train where each carriage represents a node in a linked list. Each carriage contains passengers (data) and a connector to the next carriage (pointer). The first carriage is called the head of the linked list.

Now, let's break down the WHY, WHAT, and HOW of linked lists:

WHY use linked lists?
Linked lists are useful when you need dynamic memory allocation, such as when the number of elements is unknown or can change over time. Unlike arrays, linked lists can easily expand or shrink without the need for moving elements in memory.

WHAT are the key components of a linked list?
1. Nodes: The building blocks of a linked list. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
2. Head: The first node in the linked list.
3. Tail: The last node in the linked list, where the pointer points to null, indicating the end of the list.

HOW does a linked list work?
To perform operations on a linked list, you need to understand how to traverse and manipulate the nodes. Here are some common operations:

1. Traversing: Start at the head and follow the pointers until you reach the end of the list (null).
2. Insertion: To insert a new node, create a new node, update the pointers of the previous and next nodes accordingly, and adjust the head and tail if necessary.
3. Deletion: To delete a node, update the pointers of the previous and next nodes to bypass the node you want to remove, and adjust the head and tail if necessary.
