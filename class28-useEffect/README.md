Sure, here are the questions along with their short answers:

1. **Main Use Case of useEffect Hook:**
   - **Answer:** The main use case of the `useEffect` hook in React is to handle side effects, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscription management, in functional components.

2. **Interaction of Effect Logic with Component:**
   - **Answer:** The effect's logic in the `useEffect` hook runs after the component renders. It can read and update the component's state and props, and interact with the DOM. It's often used to perform tasks that need to happen after the component has rendered.

3. **Importance of Return Value from Effect Logic Function:**
   - **Answer:** The return value from the effect's logic function is used for cleanup. It's optional but important. If provided, it's executed when the component unmounts or when the effect dependencies change before the next execution. This is where you can clean up resources like event listeners or cancel subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.
